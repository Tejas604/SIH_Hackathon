## Contract Farming
Contract farming is basically a variety of formal or informal agreements between producers (`companies`) and processors / buyers (`Farmers`)

These can be of 3 types : 
1. **Loose buying Agreements** :
There is no tight bound on the producer to have to buy it from the farmer and neither is there any restriction on the farmer to have to sell it to the producer whom it is signed with.<br>The only thing is that first preference will be given to the producer whom it is signed with <br><br>

2. **Simple purchasing Agreements**
There is just a simple agreement of the quantity of produce required after a specified amount of time .<br><br>

3. **Supervised production with Input provisions**
the company that has contracted with the farmer will decide on : 
   - How the crop is to be produced.
   - Will supervise the production process.
   - Will invest and provide the resources.
   - Will provide loan facilities
   - Will provide risk coverages and take responsibility for losses
